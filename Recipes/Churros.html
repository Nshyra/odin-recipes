        <h1>Churros</h1>
        <img src="../images/Churros.jpg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A cinnamon and sugar topped fried pastry. Kind of like Doughnuts but Churros
            are in the form of a stick. Although they are crispy on the outside they are
            soft and fluffy on the inside. Can never go wrong with fresh churros for desert
            or for whenever.</p>
